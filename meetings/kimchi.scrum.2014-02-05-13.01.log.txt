13:09:03 <alinefm> ok
13:09:30 <alinefm> I believe everyone received feedbacks/comments on RFC, right?
13:09:47 <alinefm> anyone has blockers? or anything to discuss about the RFC?
13:10:25 <AdamKingIT> I still owe lagarcia a review of the help RFC :-[
13:11:04 <alinefm> AdamKingIT, I think you mean vianac =)
13:11:06 <lagarcia> AdamKingIT, me? I think it was someone else
13:11:10 <lagarcia> AdamKingIT, ok :)
13:11:14 <AdamKingIT> sorry, yes
13:11:33 <alinefm> AdamKingIT, lagarcia will work on the authorization task
13:11:33 <AdamKingIT> More coffee!
13:11:41 <pvital> lol
13:11:50 * pvital needs too!
13:12:06 <alinefm> rotru, what is pending on your RFC?
13:12:21 <alinefm> as you said "API implementation is under discussion"
13:12:58 <rotru> alinefm;  I sent V2
13:13:11 <rotru> alinefm; did not see any comment on it
13:15:17 <alinefm> checking...
13:15:23 <alinefm> rotru, Eject cd operation will not be provided
13:15:34 <alinefm> the DELETE operation should eject the cdrom, right?
13:16:07 <rotru> alinefm;  could be
13:16:58 <rotru> alinefm;  I just followed what was in the wiki :)
13:16:58 <alinefm> rotru, christyp has suggested to use 'media' instead of 'storages' on API
13:17:23 <alinefm> christyp, I personally like "storages" or "disks"
13:18:23 <AdamKingIT> storage +1 :-)
13:19:27 <rotru> alinefm;  are we going to use the api to others disks, or usb disks, etc ?
13:19:35 <alinefm> rotru, yes
13:20:22 <rotru> alinefm;  so, maybe storages makes more sense
13:20:27 <alinefm> ok
13:20:30 <alinefm> go for it =)
13:20:55 <rotru> ok =]
13:21:10 <alinefm> just remembering the patch must be on mail list by next Monday
13:21:31 <alinefm> #topic Open discussion
13:21:45 <alinefm> what will we discuss today?
13:22:44 <alinefm> silence... =)
13:23:01 <rotru> alinefm; I think we need to investigate the problem with F20
13:23:04 <alinefm> maybe everyone has all needed to implement the tasks
13:23:09 <rotru> F20 and sosreport
13:23:22 <alinefm> rotru, what is the problem on F20?
13:24:04 <rotru> alinefm;  the tool has and uses some py modules, with are returning errors
13:24:45 <alinefm> rotru, do you mean the sosreport?
13:24:49 <rotru> alinefm;  according to my tests , the tool is able to generate the report, but kimchi does not recognize
13:25:03 <rotru> alinefm;  yes
13:25:22 <alinefm> rotru, what is the output of "sosreport --batch my-sosrepor"
13:25:25 <alinefm> ?
13:25:31 <alinefm> but it on pastebin, please
13:25:40 <alinefm> and also the returned code "echo $?"
13:25:46 <rotru> alinefm;  I remove the tool from my system
13:25:47 <rotru> =P
13:26:21 <rotru> alinefm;  installing again
13:26:25 <rotru> give some minutes
13:26:37 <danielhb> alinefm, Logical Pool update = patch is ready, but I was hoping to get an answer from libvirt-users ML. No answer so far
13:27:28 <alinefm> danielhb, you can try the IRC channel #virt
13:27:45 <danielhb> alinefm, guess I'll do that
13:28:04 <danielhb> alinefm, apparently the ML is not that "popular" as you mentioned
13:28:13 <danielhb> alinefm, kimchi's ML is way more agile!
13:28:39 <alinefm> danielhb, my experience was on devel list
13:28:45 <lagarcia> danielhb, or you might not be as popular as you think on the mailing list :p
13:29:07 <lagarcia> danielhb, yep... devel list is usually fast to get responses. usually.
13:29:27 <danielhb> lagarcia, HAHAHAHHA
13:29:44 <danielhb> lagarcia, "how is this guy?? Not answering to some random "
13:30:34 <alinefm> rotru, you can try what I commented and send the results to mail list
13:30:49 <rotru> alinefm;  sure, will do iyt
13:30:51 <rotru> it
13:30:57 <lagarcia> alinefm, rotru I run sosreport on my Fedora 20 and got an error as well
13:31:08 <lagarcia> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/74614/13916070/
13:31:17 <lagarcia> but it definitely seems to be an issus with sosreport
13:31:19 <rotru> lagarcia;  yeap ... cristian also found
13:31:38 <alinefm> lagarcia, try to run the sosreport command outside kimchi
13:31:46 <rotru> lagarcia;  exactly ! thats it
13:31:53 <lagarcia> alinefm, sure... but from the error output, it is not a kimchi issue
13:31:55 <alinefm> I want to figure out if the command is running properly or not first
13:32:43 <lagarcia> alinefm, just ran it... same error (for "sosreport --batch my-sosrepor")
13:32:58 <alinefm> lagarcia, are you running it with sudo?
13:33:06 <lagarcia> alinefm, yep
13:33:36 <alinefm> lagarcia, rotru, seems we will need to look on sosreport forums/mail list to get some directions for it
13:33:47 <lagarcia> alinefm, the issue I am seeing is that for some reason, in the command line, even though I get the same errors, the report finishes to run. In kimchi, just after the error is hit, even though sosreport tool probably continues to run, kimchi logs out...
13:34:17 <lagarcia> and when I log in again, no sosreport is there. But I can be doing something wrong... I just started using kimchi yesterday :)
13:35:02 <alinefm> lagarcia, kimchi checks the returned code
13:35:16 <alinefm> after running sosreport command, what is the returned code?
13:35:21 <alinefm> is it zero?
13:35:25 <alinefm> even with errors...
13:35:40 <lagarcia> alinefm, actually I was just saying something wrong... the sosreport is kind of stuck... all the instances I started from command line and kimchi got stuck near the execution end.
13:35:46 <lagarcia> alinefm, so no return errors yet
13:35:51 <lagarcia> that's why kimchi is still not showing them.
13:36:03 <lagarcia> alinefm, just don't understand why I was logged out... but I'll check this later.
13:37:11 <alinefm> lagarcia, ok
13:37:20 <alinefm> I will set a F20 machine to check it
13:37:30 <rotru> alinefm; lagarcia installed and ran ... the return code is 0
13:37:36 <rotru> even with the errors
13:38:00 <lagarcia> rotru, ok. good... so that might be something else on my machine that is apparently making sosreport to get stuck
13:38:40 <alinefm> rotru, and you can open the sosreport generated?
13:38:48 <alinefm> rotru, if so, it is a kimchi issue
13:39:22 <christyp> did you guys see the fedora 20 sosreport bug that's mirrored to rh from our bugzilla?
13:39:37 <alinefm> christyp, nope! do you have a link for it/
13:39:51 <rotru> alinefm;  checking the tar.xz
13:39:54 <christyp> i put it into the kimchi bug opened for the sosreports
13:39:56 <christyp> i can find it
13:40:15 <christyp> https://bugzilla.linux.ibm.com/show_bug.cgi?id=99234
13:40:28 <rotru> alinefm; yeap, I can open it
13:42:14 <alinefm> https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport/issues/216
13:42:42 <christyp> here's the redhat bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1028102 though i' not sure if it's private or not
13:42:52 <alinefm> on bug, there are some comments to run "sosreport -vvv -n networking"
13:43:03 <alinefm> that way sosreport can ends properly
13:43:32 <lagarcia> alinefm, yep... I am having issues with networking sosreport plugin
13:43:45 <lagarcia> alinefm, so I am probably hitting this issue
13:44:11 <lagarcia> alinefm, rotru anyway, I think this is the kind of discussion we can have offline in the mailing list afterwards
13:44:19 <alinefm> and other comments mentioned to run: "sosreport -vvv -n gluster,cluster,yum,networking"
13:44:26 <alinefm> lagarcia, yeap
13:44:50 <lagarcia> alinefm, yeah... the modules with errors are yum and gluster... so, basically disable everything with issues and you are fine, hehe
13:44:58 <alinefm> hehehe
13:45:25 <alinefm> ok - let's continue it on mail list
13:45:32 <alinefm> anything else to discuss today?
13:45:56 <danielhb> are we moving to gerrit here too?
13:46:15 <alinefm> danielhb, no
13:46:27 <danielhb> ty ty!
13:47:19 <alinefm> danielhb, when we get a really high rate of reviews on mail list I will think more about moving to gerrit
13:47:20 <alinefm> =)
13:47:45 <danielhb> alinefm, please, don't :)
13:48:15 <alinefm> hehehe
13:48:35 <alinefm> anything else?
13:49:24 <alinefm> ok
13:49:44 <alinefm> thanks all for joining
13:49:51 <alinefm> and also to send the RFC on time
13:49:59 <rotru> alinefm;  thanks
13:50:02 <alinefm> I am looking forward to review the patches on Monday =)
