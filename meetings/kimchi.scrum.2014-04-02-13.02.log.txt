13:14:46 <alinefm> #topic Kimchi 1.2.1 plan
13:15:00 <alinefm> I sent a note to mail list yesterday with some links to github wiki
13:15:21 <alinefm> the milestones is there: https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/wiki/Planning-1.2.1
13:15:32 <alinefm> the todo list: https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/wiki/Todo-1.2.1
13:15:50 <alinefm> and the bugs we should close for 1.2.1 release: https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/issues?milestone=13&state=open
13:16:28 <alinefm> As I said before I want to make Kimchi more stable in 1.2.1 so we will have a few new feature and focus in improve what we have in Kimchi
13:16:39 <alinefm> do you have any comments about all that plan?
13:18:00 <rotru> alinefm; just take on account that that are 3 holidays in brazil
13:18:22 <royce> Github is quite slow ... I can't open it these days...
13:18:46 <shaohef> yes. same to me.
13:18:56 <AdamKingIT11> royce: I haven't had issues.
13:19:11 <alinefm> me neither
13:19:17 <alinefm> just open it so fast right now
13:19:21 <royce> maybe it is Chinese great fire wall AdamKingIT1....
13:19:29 <AdamKingIT11> Tried different network connections/systems to see if you can narrow it
13:19:59 <AdamKingIT11> GFW occurred to me, but seemed an odd thing to be blocked
13:21:31 <AdamKingIT11> I suppose I am not th ebest guesser about what is and is not :-)
13:22:33 <royce> >_< vpn is not working either, let's move on, I'll try to open it after
13:23:09 <alinefm> royce, ok - any time you can bring up your ideas
13:23:27 <royce> ok alinefm
13:23:34 <alinefm> any other comments about  the plan?
13:24:41 <alinefm> so let's start the sprint 1
13:24:55 <alinefm> anyone can choose any task to do just update the wiki properly
13:25:07 <alinefm> the same for the bugs
13:26:12 <shaohef> everyone take one ?
13:27:12 <shaohef> For I can not open the git hub now. please leave one for me. :)
13:27:23 <alinefm> shaohef, royce, http://fpaste.org/90942/13964452/
13:27:32 <alinefm> those are the backend tasks for sprint 1
13:27:40 <alinefm> which one do you want to work on?
13:27:49 <alinefm> I can update the wiki with your names
13:28:11 <pradeep> alinefm: Enable Connect is needed before working on migration i feel.
13:28:13 <royce> the CDROM is what I'm working on
13:28:58 <shaohef> alinefm: Ming is working on  Migration: investigate how discover Kimchi peers
13:29:00 <alinefm> royce, CDROM limit?
13:29:12 <rotru> alinefm; VM Edit: CPU and memory
13:29:23 <alinefm> shaohef, pradeep, about this tasks I was thinking in do an investigation
13:29:36 <alinefm> how we will connect, transfer vm disks, discover peers and so
13:29:40 <royce> yeah, I'm testing my patch on rhel and opensuse
13:29:52 <alinefm> when we complete the investigation we can know better the amount of work we need to do
13:29:54 <shaohef> alinefm: then which leaves to me?
13:30:24 <shaohef> royce:  what about leave  VM Edit: CPU and memory to me?
13:30:31 <alinefm> Add Version/build number
13:30:32 <alinefm> Add mechanism to translate help pages
13:30:40 <alinefm> Manage guest disks
13:30:40 <alinefm> History data view
13:30:45 <royce> shaohef, that suits you!
13:30:59 <alinefm> shaohef, rotru got this
13:31:18 <shaohef> royce:  OK. let rotru got it.
13:31:25 <shaohef> alinefm: ^
13:31:30 <rotru> shaohef;  thanks :)
13:31:51 <shaohef> alinefm:  other's no one take, you can assign it to me.
13:31:58 <alinefm> shaohef, how about "Add Version/build number"?
13:32:05 <shaohef> alinefm: OK.
13:32:25 <shaohef> not very know about this
13:32:33 <shaohef> alinefm: we can talk it later.
13:32:39 <alinefm> I think there are more tasks than developers so we dont need to fight
13:32:49 <alinefm> shaohef, ok
13:33:01 <alinefm> shaohef,  it is about show the kimchi version/build in the UI
13:33:14 <alinefm> that way we can easily identify which version the user is using
13:33:30 <alinefm> we need to consider when kimchi is installed or not
13:33:37 <alinefm> maybe return it on /config
13:34:18 <alinefm> #info shaohef Add Version/build number
13:34:24 <AdamKingIT11> We will want to pull it into the UI through the cheetah template, as well as include it on the rest api somewhere like /config
13:34:27 <alinefm> #info royce CDROM limit devices
13:34:35 <alinefm> #info rotru VM Edit: CPU and memory
13:38:32 <alinefm> alright?
13:38:48 <rotru> ok
13:39:03 <royce> +1
13:39:33 <alinefm> let's move on

13:39:47 <alinefm> what are the topics for today?
13:40:21 <royce> I have encountered doesns of problem on opensuse...
13:41:19 <royce> Some python package does not included in opensuse 13.1 distro repo, libvirtd does not start... Have anyone encountered these?
13:44:37 <rotru> royce;  sorry, I do not run suse
13:44:42 <rotru> run/test
13:44:44 <AdamKingIT11> seems we are in slow motion today...

13:45:13 <royce> :)thanks rotru
13:45:20 <alinefm> royce, I run on opensuse and it works fine the times I tested

13:45:53 <alinefm> have you installed the spacewalk repo?
13:46:27 <royce> I installed each repo by searching it on opensuse official web
13:47:12 <shaohef> *Note for openSUSE users*: Some of the above packages are located in the
13:47:12 <shaohef> openSUSE Systems Management repository. See
13:47:12 <shaohef> [this FAQ](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/systemsmanagement:/spacewalk/)
13:47:12 <shaohef> to get the correct repository based on your openSUSE version. And
13:47:12 <shaohef> [this FAQ](http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Add_package_repositories) for more
13:47:12 <shaohef> information on how configure your system to access this repository.
13:47:17 <royce> And some python lib itself has indented problem, aweful...
13:47:35 <royce> Oh, thanks shaohef
13:48:03 <royce> I guess I can turn to you tomorrow, shaohef
13:48:14 <shaohef> OK.
