<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">13:02:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> I think this is all
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">13:02:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> The team has been very busy while I was out last week so I am going to ask for some help catching up.
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">13:03:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> great...

<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">13:03:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> As most of you noticed, last week alinefm was very helpful and she collected patches into a staging branch so they could be merged when I returned.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">13:04:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> First of all, thanks to her for helping out with that...
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">13:04:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Second:</span> I think that worked so well that I'd like to ask her to continue helping share the responsibility of staging and merging patches.
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">13:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> aglitke, i disagree that.
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">13:05:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> aglitke, thank you for the opportunity!
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">13:05:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> It should help us to increase our velocity.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">13:05:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> i think we need one from different timezone
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">13:06:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ming:</span> We can look into that in the future.  But this is really my decision about who I want to work with.  It's easier for me to coordinate with someone in my own timezone.
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">13:06:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hlwanghl&gt;</span> we have 9 or 10 guys in China
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">13:06:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> yes.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">13:06:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> aglitke, that can not help  China team.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">13:07:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> markwu Is helping with maintainership of the kimchi-ginger branch.  So I can see that responsibility evolving over time.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">13:08:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> we should need a one familiar with kimchi code.
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">13:08:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> I am happy that shaohef has stepped up to help maintain issues.
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">13:08:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> to maintainership kimchi branch
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">13:08:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> aglitke, you know we need work overtime to catch a maintainer from your time zone. That is not easy.
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">13:08:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> Going from 1 to 2 will give us a chance to work out the mechanics of &gt;1. Hopefully we get so many contributors, we'll need to go 2+ real soon
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">13:08:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hlwanghl&gt;</span> a major part of patches are from China team, so it will help much if we have one in China
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">13:09:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> I think the main issue of getting patches merged  in a good time is about reviewing
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">13:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ming:</span> Thanks for your suggestion.  We will continue to work as a team to manage the difficulties with timezones.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">13:10:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> if everyone reviews patches I can apply them sooner without having problems with timezones
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">13:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> alinefm, we'll look forward to helping you assume this additional work!
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">13:10:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alinefm:</span> Agreed.  The more thoroughly patches are reviewed, the easier and faster they can be merged.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">13:11:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Yes, thank you alinefm!
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">13:11:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> sorry guys, but we are ONE team. I don't care if the commiter is in China, Europe, US or Brazil. The point is submit the patches and get them reviewed
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">13:11:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">KVM Forum summary</span>
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">13:11:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> tell us about KVM forum?
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">13:12:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> maybe I can help  with maintain patch.  I'm familiar with git tool. And help most member of  China team for their git manager and Makefile configure.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">13:12:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> agtitke, not that way always.  Even after full review from the others, maintain can block the integration for quite a while.
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">13:12:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> So kimchi was very well received at KVM Forum!  I presented in a packed room.  The audience was impressed with the clean UI and the ease of use.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">13:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> you have a guess how many people were packed in?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">13:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Several people asked me when/if kimchi would be ready to replace virt-manager.
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">13:13:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> aglitke, did your talk recorded?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">13:14:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AdamKingIT:</span> We were in a smaller salon but at least 60 I would assume.  aliguori was there and several other maintainers from libvirt, etc.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">13:14:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> we have a little ways to go, but cool that are thinking that way
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">13:14:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> oh very good!
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">13:14:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hlwanghl&gt;</span> a good beginning
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">13:14:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">pvital:</span> Yes it was.  I will let everyone know once the videos for the Forum have been released.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">13:14:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> 60 is a pretty good crowd
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">13:15:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> I was able to demonstrate ISO streaming as a preview feature and people were very excited about it.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">13:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> One comment that I think we should take seriously is the need to have kimchi packaged in distros.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">13:15:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Most people will try a new project by first installing the distro package.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">13:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Only then will they download the source and make improvements.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">13:16:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> We have offers of help from the Fedora community already.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">13:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> aglitke, nice! we can use twitter, facebook and google+ to share the video and improve the marketing of kimchi
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">13:16:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> great
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">13:16:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> ANd we should really work hard to add Ubuntu and openSUSE to the list.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">13:17:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">pvital:</span> Yes, very good suggestion.  Anyone should feel free to market kimchi in their own social circles.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">13:17:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> aglitke, what is the process to that?
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">13:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> if there is one
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">13:17:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Kimchi is seen to directly address a gap we've had in the KVM tools for a long time.
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">13:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alinefm:</span> Each distro has its own process.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">13:18:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> It can be a bit involved, but we have skills in this area already.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">13:18:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> aglitke, I have some experience with RPM and can help with it
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">13:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> I have done a fedora package for MOM
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">13:18:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">pvital:</span> Excellent.  You could look at openSUSE
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">13:19:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> sure!
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">13:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> we already can build rpms today.  We just need to get our package included in the official repos
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">13:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> but we need more features, then we can  get our package included in the official repos
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">13:19:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> So... I guess that's all I have to report from KVM Forum.
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">13:20:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">shaohef:</span> I think 1.0 is really good enough to start packaging.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">13:20:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> It can already do some cool things.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">13:20:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> You never want to wait until your finished to start.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">13:20:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> In official repos will push us to evolve
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">13:21:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> So in summary, great work guys!  People like what they see.

<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">13:30:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zhoumeina&gt;</span> we have just sent patchset to support spice
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">13:30:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> ming, it is on the patch cover letter but basically you just need to applu my patches and specify an URL to creata a template
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">13:31:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> royce, I would like a all one on on FC18 or FC19.

<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">13:31:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> I think that can do, because it works around libvirt and qemu problem
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">13:32:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> shaohef, qemu-io got stucked because the mis-use of curl when resolving the hostname

<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">13:32:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> shaohef, it is about the URL for remote ISO
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">13:33:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alinefm&gt;</span> shaohef, on FC19 qemu gets stuck because it could not resolve the hostname, but if we use ip it works fine
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">13:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;markwu&gt;</span> aglitke, I didn't cover the UI part.
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">13:33:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">alinefm:</span> the ip is same with the cherrpy server?

<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">13:34:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">shaohef:</span> No. this is the IP of the server that hosts the ISO image
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">13:34:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hlwanghl&gt;</span> markwu we can work together on UI part
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">13:34:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> it can be anywhere
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">13:34:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> markwu, I think plugin might not a good word. I think it is just another application, not a plugin.
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">13:35:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> I prefer plugin.  Application hints that it runs as a separate process.
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">13:35:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> I remember a patch from meina to cover the UI extension. Did I dream that?
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">13:35:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> The plugin is extending the rest api

<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">13:37:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> I am anxious to try it.
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">13:37:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> I'll look for it and review. We may want to start to incorporate a notion of how auth will work for extensions. I saw an interesting talk by the paypal api arch last week that made me think...
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">13:37:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> It seems we have patches out for nearly all S1 features.
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">13:37:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> sorry to interrupt one more ask, guys do you like my way using sub-resources to deal with vm disks and nics, snapshots and so on?  when referring to vm edit we will not touch its subresources~
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">13:37:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">royce:</span> Yes, I think that is a good idea.
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">13:37:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> aglitke, so it is a extension implemented by a seperate application. Extension may be better.
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">13:37:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span>  if an ether nic exists create macvtap, or a linux bridge exists ， then create a linux bridge network.
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">13:38:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> It will allow us to add/remove disks and nics.
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">13:38:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zhoumeina&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AdamKingIT:</span> I wonder what is the orginal purpose of autogenerate tabs by add tab htmls?
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">13:38:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> thanks aglitke, then we can move on on those edit features~

<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">13:39:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">royce:</span>  yes. I write my snapshot use subresources as VM already.
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">13:39:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> yeah, I know, shaohef
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">13:39:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zhoumeina&gt;</span> We want to make UI customize or just more convient to add tabs?
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">13:39:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">royce:</span>  it is convenience to edit VM

<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">13:40:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zhoumeina&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AdamKingIT:</span> ok
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">13:40:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zhoumeina:</span> main goal is to support functional extensions, so new capabilities manifest in the UI
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">13:41:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zhoumeina:</span> The plan is that extensions will just add their own tabs but will not modify existing tabs.
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">13:41:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span>  I will  integrate all patches include UI into one, and let every  to try. and then split it for review.
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">13:41:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span> about the network.
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">13:41:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">shaohef:</span> Is that necessary?  I think it is easy enough to apply a series (as long as it does not need a rebase).
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">13:42:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zhoumeina&gt;</span> <span class="hi">AdamKingIT:</span> that is what I think
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">13:42:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span>  someone think it is not convenience to save as so many patches and apply them.
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">13:42:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> shaohef, I always like a slef-containe package.  But I am a developer, I can apply you patch into my workspace and install them correctly.

<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">13:43:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> ok... So we all have a long list of patches to review.
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">13:43:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span>  a good way to download  too many patches and apply them.
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">13:43:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hlwanghl&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span> sure
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">13:43:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Thanks in advance to everyone for helping us clear the patch backlog by reviewing code.
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">13:43:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span> do you use mutt?
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">13:44:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">shaohef:</span> Yes!
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">13:44:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> aglitke, do we have a tool to measure our review?
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">13:44:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zhoumeina&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span> shaohef:we have los of issues in github that have not add tags and send out
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">13:44:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> it makes managing patches much easuer
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">13:44:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">royce:</span> No not really.  There are tools that can scan Reviewed-by tags on the mailing list.
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">13:44:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zhoumeina:</span>  I will tags them with aglitke
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">13:44:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zhoumeina&gt;</span> some of those issues created long ago
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">13:45:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> But I have found that when you track that stat it encourages people to do more superfluous reviews.
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">13:45:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> sometimes our boss ask us our review activities, I will look for some~
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">13:45:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> I'd rather people spend more time doing a smaller number of deep. substantive reviews.
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">13:45:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> :))))
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">13:45:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> that's true
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">13:45:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span> got it. most of us use thunderbird. :) thunderbird it not convenience to manage so many patches.
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">13:45:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> So it's a hard stat to track.
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">13:46:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">shaohef:</span> Yeah, that is why I do not use it.
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">13:46:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Maybe Evolution is better?
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">13:46:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> Anyway, gerrit may be better to tack review stats.
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">13:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> I think it comes under the heading of "be careful what you measure, its what you are going to get"
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">13:46:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;shaohef&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aglitke:</span>  Evolution better than mutt?
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">13:46:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> And gerrit can easily apply a set of patches
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">13:46:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">shaohef:</span> Not for me, but maybe for you.

<a name="l-269"></a><span class="tm">13:57:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">markwu:</span> Yes, they all should be written in a cross platform, distro-neutral fashion
<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">13:57:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> ming, royce: https://github.com/kimchi-project/kimchi/wiki/Todo-1.1
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">13:58:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;markwu&gt;</span> so the host management is also the coverage of kimchi, right?  that's my understanding.  but fnovak told me it belongs to kimchi-ginger.  I am very confused about the line between kimchi and kimchi-ginger
<a name="l-272"></a><span class="tm">13:58:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> pvital, thanks.
<a name="l-273"></a><span class="tm">13:59:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> that line bears some discussion...
<a name="l-274"></a><span class="tm">13:59:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> markwu, we may setup a call with Frank about that.
<a name="l-275"></a><span class="tm">13:59:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> kimchi doesn't aim to be primarily in the host management business, but some features are useful for the KVM admin
<a name="l-276"></a><span class="tm">13:59:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;AdamKingIT&gt;</span> some or more host unique, and belong in ginger
<a name="l-277"></a><span class="tm">13:59:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> markwu, I understood that we have both goals: host and KoP support :-D
<a name="l-278"></a><span class="tm">13:59:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;royce&gt;</span> thanks I see, pvital, it is about the LVM pool
<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">13:59:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> markwu, IMO, ginger is for power platform and most of the tasks are host management.
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">14:00:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">markwu:</span> It is confusing.  We need to decide which things belong in the main host tab and which ones will go into the extra tab
<a name="l-281"></a><span class="tm">14:00:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;markwu&gt;</span> aglitke, exactly!
<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">14:00:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> <span class="hi">pvital:</span> what is KoP?
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">14:00:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> royce, yeah! we need support to  add new disks in a LVM pool
<a name="l-284"></a><span class="tm">14:00:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> One example is the feature for creating a storage pool from a physical disl
<a name="l-285"></a><span class="tm">14:00:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;pvital&gt;</span> ming, KVM on Power
<a name="l-286"></a><span class="tm">14:00:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> that is really beyond the scope of kimchi core
<a name="l-287"></a><span class="tm">14:00:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ming&gt;</span> pvital, are you work on KVM on Power?
<a name="l-288"></a><span class="tm">14:01:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> So the API to enumerate host disks and convert them to storage pools will probably belong on the ginger tab
<a name="l-289"></a><span class="tm">14:01:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">markwu:</span> We will need to have a review on a per-feature basis.
<a name="l-290"></a><span class="tm">14:01:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;markwu&gt;</span> but it's definitely helpful for virutalization management

<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">14:01:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aglitke&gt;</span> Basic host mgmt: reboot, update, debugreport,. etc is ginger core and belongs on the kimchi host tab
